## pH7Builder CLI Installation Wizard ðŸ§™

### The first CLI Dating Builder Installer Tool  ðŸ˜» (ever invented ðŸª„)

### How to use it?

Inside of this folder (`_tools/cli-installation`), run `php installer ph7builder:run`

Then, follow the instructions.

## Go to know

When using this cli command to install pH7Builder (AKA pH7CMS), you have to make sure that you didn't rename the `_protected` folder.

The database configuration has less options. For instance, you can't change the prefix when creating the tables in the database, meaning you won't be able to have two same installations using the same database (if so, you will have to create a second database, or using the [traditional Web installer](http://ph7cms.com/doc/en/insall) instead).

## Troubleshooting

If you occur any issues, please report them [by raising an issue](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/issues).
